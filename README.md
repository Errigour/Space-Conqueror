Nothing complicated about this game it's just a simple c# program
compiled with Visual Studios Community on Windows 10. Download
Visual Studios Community. Install it with Windows Application
Development and .NET desktop development. Im not sure if that's
all you need tho but try I also have c++ stuff installed and database
and linux embedded packages.

Anyways open the file Space Conqueror.csproj with Visual Studios
and press F5 to compile it. Or you can just navigate in the bin
directory and find the Space Conqueror.exe file and play the game.

Happy Coding.
